    # to modify or change these options is either in an initializer or your specific environment file. Keep
    # in mind that these options can be modified on the instance level when creating an object. See #initialize
    # for more details.

    # === Options
    #
    # * <tt>:test</tt> - this basically tells us which url to use. If set to true we will use the FedEx test URL, if false we
    #   will use the production URL. If you are using this in a rails app, unless you are in your production environment, this
    #   will default to true automatically.
    # * <tt>:test_url</tt> - the test URL for FedEx's webservices. (default: https://gatewaybeta.fedex.com:443/xml)
    # * <tt>:production_url</tt> - the production URL for FedEx's webservices. (default: https://gateway.fedex.com:443/xml)
